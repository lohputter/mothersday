            <p>Thanks for always being there to take care of me. Depending on which order I gave the stuff, you may have gotten the physical card first but I cannot emphasise enough on what you have done for us.</p>

            <p>Thanks for always putting a smile on our faces! :D </p>
            <p>Thanks for always being there to talk to us! :D </p>
            <p>Thanks for supporting us and allowing us to do what we feel like doing in the moment. :D </p>
            <p>Thanks for being our mother! ;)</p>
            <p>Thank you mama and I love you so much. Without you, I am not very sure what I could do. You always help me in studies or making decisions and you have helped me grow as an individual. So thanks for being my mother. It doesn't get any better.</p>
